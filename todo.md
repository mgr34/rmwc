# To-do

## Purpose of this file

As of 05-01-2022 RMWC is behind some major versions of Material Components (MWC). The RMWC community has taken an intiative to get the project up to speed with MWC. This initiative will be tackled by bumping MWC one version at a time.

The idea is to bump a major of MWC (e.g. from 5.0.0 to 6.0.0) and fix breaking changes to **currently implemented** components. It is not expected that new feature and new components will be added during bumping the version, unless they break currently implemented features and components. It is therefore up to the community to contribute by implementing new features and components in seperate pull requests.

Below you will find a to-do list from each version of MWC with features and components to be implemented. If you see a feature or component you would like to implement or have implemented, feel free to either make a pull request with the feature or component, or create an issue.

The to-do list are based on the CHANGELOG.md file from the material-components-web project. Check out the CHANGELOG.md file of material-components-web for more detail.

Remember to remove the to-do once a feature or components has been implemented.
